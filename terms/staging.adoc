=== Staging (staging area/index)

* It notes the added files in the working directory/copy - a copy of the most recent state of the files you're working on.
* To stage a file is simply to prepare it finely for a commit. 
* Refer to the link:index.adoc#_git_add[diagram].
* Git, with its index allows you to commit only certain parts of the changes you've done since the last commit.
* Further Details can be found https://medium.com/mindorks/what-is-git-commit-push-pull-log-aliases-fetch-config-clone-56bc52a3601c[here].
