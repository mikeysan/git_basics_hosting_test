=== Repository

* Git stores information in a data structure called a repository (repo).
* Simply put, a repo is a place where the history of the user's work is stored. 
* Repositories are of two types:
    ** Local repo
    ** Remote repo

For more information on the types of repos, refer to link:index.adoc#_repositories_its_types[this] section.
